    "## Logistic Regression is a statistical machine learning model used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict a categorical target variable with two possible outcomes (e.g., 0 or 1, True or False). Despite its name, it is not a regression algorithm but a classification algorithm. It can also be extended to multiclass problems using techniques like one-vs-rest or softmax regression.\n"
